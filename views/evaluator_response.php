    <h2>Hello <?=$evaluator->name?></h2>

    <p>Welcome to the National College 360 degree leadership diagnostic</p>

    <p>This diagnostic is designed to get feedback on this persons strengths and areas for development in a number of competencies related to leadership.
        This feedback will be from you and from a selection of other raters. The diagnostic will help identify what
        level they are working at for each of nineteen competencies. These are grouped into three clusters with specific competencies within each cluster.</p>

    <p>As you progress through the diagnostic, you will be asked to consider the information given for each competency - particularly the descriptions of the behaviours likely at each of four levels for that competency - and select the level you feel that they are at.</p>

    <p><strong>Guide on levels</strong></p>

    <p>Each competency has four levels and you need to decide to what extent each competency is a strength or an area for development.
        The default level for leaders who are solid performers is level three across all nineteen competencies.
        It is expected that they will have a range levels across the different competencies.</p>
